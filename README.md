## Overview

This repository contains **enterprise-style pseudocode modules** inspired by consulting practices at firms like Capgemini, Accenture, and Cognizant.  
Its purpose is to illustrate typical high-level workflows—such as client onboarding, requirements analysis, solution design, and project governance—without language-specific syntax.

Ideal for technical trainers, consultants-in-training, architects, and anyone wanting clear, language‑agnostic modeling of consulting-domain logic.
